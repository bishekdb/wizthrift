# Supabase Configuration
# Get these values from your Supabase project settings: https://app.supabase.com
VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID="your-project-id"
VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="your-anon-public-key-here"
VITE_SUPABASE_URL="https://your-project-ref.supabase.co"

# IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTES:
# 1. NEVER commit the actual .env file to Git
# 2. The PUBLISHABLE_KEY is safe to expose in frontend code (it's public by design)
# 3. Keep your SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY secret (store in Supabase dashboard, not here)
# 4. Enable Row Level Security (RLS) on all tables in Supabase
# 5. Rotate keys immediately if they are ever exposed publicly
